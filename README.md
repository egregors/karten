### Add new words
[//]: # (Add asciinem with adding process: meta & manual)

When you try to add a new word, Karten will try to get some info (translation, forms, grammar) about this word by 
particular data provider. If it fails, you can add your own translation for the word.

### Learn words

All words have his own rating, how good you know them. It's stars from 0 to 5. When 
you remember the word, one star will be added. Otherwise â€“ removed. Besides, words lose 
his rating during the time.

Each time you are run the program, Karten will choose 20 words with the smallest rating 
for you.
